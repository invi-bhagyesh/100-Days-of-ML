# 100-Days-of-ML - Progress Log
Started on 9 March 2025 (Day1)

# Day 1: Backpropagation
• Refreshed the concept of backpropagation.    
• Read:  
    - [Chapter 11](https://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/Volume%201/Chap8_PDP86.pdf) of *Parallel Distributed Processing* (where backpropagation gained popularity).  
    - [Chapter 2](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) of *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* by Michael Nielsen.  
• Implemented backpropagation from scratch in a neural network.
