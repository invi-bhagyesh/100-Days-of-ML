# 100-Days-of-ML - Progress Log
Started on 9 March 2025 (Day1)

# Day 1: Backpropagation

## What I Learned
• Refreshed the concept of backpropagation.  
• Read:
    - Chapter 11 of *Parallel Distributed Processing* (where backpropagation gained popularity).  
    - Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* by Michael Nielsen.
• Implemented backpropagation from scratch in a neural network.
